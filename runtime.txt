Introduction to Quantum Computing

Quantum computing harnesses quantum mechanical phenomena to process information in fundamentally different ways than classical computers. Unlike classical bits that exist in states of 0 or 1, quantum bits (qubits) can exist in superposition states.

Key principles:
- Superposition: qubits can be in multiple states simultaneously
- Entanglement: qubits can be correlated in quantum mechanical ways
- Quantum interference: amplifying correct answers and canceling incorrect ones

Applications:
- Cryptography and security
- Drug discovery and molecular simulation
- Financial modeling and optimization
- Machine learning and AI

Current quantum computers are noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Major challenges include quantum error correction, scalability, and developing practical quantum algorithms. Companies like IBM, Google, and others are making significant investments in quantum technology development.
