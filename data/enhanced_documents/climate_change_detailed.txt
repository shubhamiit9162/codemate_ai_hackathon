- Glacial melt contributing to acceleration
- Coastal flooding increasing in frequency

Ocean Changes:
- Ocean pH decreasing by 0.1 units (30% more acidic)
- Ocean temperatures rising throughout water column
- Marine heatwaves becoming more common
- Coral bleaching events increasing

Ecosystem Impacts:
- Species shifting ranges toward poles
- Changes in flowering and migration timing
- Increased wildfire frequency and intensity
- Forest composition changes

Regional Climate Impacts:

Small Island Nations:
- Existential threat from sea level rise
- Saltwater intrusion into freshwater supplies
- Coastal erosion and habitat loss
- Climate migration pressures

Mitigation Strategies:

- Emergency response planning

International Cooperation:

Paris Climate Agreement:
- Goal: Limit warming to well below 2°C, preferably 1.5°C
- Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
- Climate finance for developing countries
- Regular review and updating mechanisms

IPCC Reports:
- Scientific consensus on climate change
- Assessment of impacts and vulnerabilities
- Evaluation of mitigation and adaptation options
- Policy guidance for governments

Technology Transfer:
- Clean technology sharing
- Capacity building in developing countries
- International research collaboration
- Finance mechanisms for clean development

Economic Considerations:

Costs of Inaction:
- Annual losses could reach 23% of global GDP by 2100
- Infrastructure damage from extreme weather
- Agricultural productivity losses
- Health care costs from climate-related illness
- Mass migration and conflict risks

Investment Required:
- $2.4 trillion annually needed for energy transition
- $300 billion annually for adaptation measures
- Return on investment: $4-7 for every $1 spent on adaptation
- Green jobs creation potential: 24 million by 2030

Current Status and Future Projections:

Based on current policies:
- Global temperature increase: 2.7-3.1°C by 2100
- Sea level rise: 0.43-2.84 meters by 2300
- Increased frequency of extreme events
- Significant ecosystem disruption

With aggressive action:
- Possible to limit warming to 1.5-2°C
- Reduced but still significant impacts
- Economic benefits of early action
- Preserved ecosystem services

Time Sensitivity:
- Carbon budget for 1.5°C: ~400 GtCO2 remaining
- Need 45% emission reduction by 2030
- Net zero emissions by 2050 required
- Every year of delay increases costs and risks

The science is clear: immediate, sustained, and large-scale action is required across all sectors to address climate change effectively.
