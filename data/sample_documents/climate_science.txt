Climate Change Science

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. Scientific evidence overwhelmingly shows human activities as the primary driver since the mid-20th century.

Primary Causes:
- Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels
- Deforestation and land use changes
- Industrial processes and manufacturing
- Agriculture and livestock farming
- Transportation systems

Observable Effects:
- Global temperature rise
- Melting ice caps and glaciers
- Sea level rise
- Extreme weather events
- Ecosystem disruption
- Ocean acidification

Scientific Consensus:
Over 97% of climate scientists agree that human activities are the primary cause of recent climate change. The evidence comes from multiple sources including temperature records, ice core data, and atmospheric measurements.

Mitigation Strategies:
- Renewable energy adoption
- Energy efficiency improvements
- Carbon capture and storage
- Sustainable transportation
- Forest conservation and reforestation
- International cooperation and policies

Adaptation Measures:
- Building climate-resilient infrastructure
- Developing drought-resistant crops
- Implementing early warning systems
- Protecting coastal areas from sea level rise

The Paris Climate Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit it to 1.5°C.
