## ‚ú® About The Project

**Deep Research Agent** is a powerful tool that transforms the way you interact with information. Instead of manually sifting through multiple documents, you can simply upload your sources, ask a question, and let the AI agent do the heavy lifting.

The application analyzes the provided documents, identifies the most relevant information, and generates a concise **Executive Summary** and a list of **Key Findings**. It provides detailed metrics on the sources, relevance, and quality of the information found, ensuring a high degree of confidence in the results.

This project was built to empower researchers, students, and professionals to find answers faster and more efficiently.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project is built with a modern tech stack. While the exact stack is up to the developer, a typical implementation might look like this:

**Frontend:**
* [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the build tool

**Backend:**
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) or [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) for the web server
* [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) or a similar framework for orchestrating AI agents and models
* [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) for NLP models
* Vector Database (e.g., [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/), [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)) for semantic search

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* Node.js and npm (or yarn)
* An API key from an AI provider (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Anthropic)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name.git](https://github.com/your_username/your_repo_name.git)
    cd your_repo_name
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend (Python):**
    * Create and activate a virtual environment:
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
        ```
    * The backend logic, which uses standard libraries like `os` for handling file paths and environment variables, can be set up by installing dependencies:
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```sh
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    * Add your API keys and other configurations:
        ```
        AI_PROVIDER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server** from the root directory:
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
2.  **Start the frontend development server** from the `frontend` directory:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
3.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified).

## üìñ Usage

1.  **Upload Documents:** Drag and drop your source files into the "Upload Documents" area.
2.  **Enter Your Query:** Type your research question into the "Research Query" input field.
3.  **Run the Agent:** Click the "Research" button to begin the analysis.
4.  **Review Results:** Examine the generated Executive Summary and Key Findings. You can also review the detailed analysis section to see which sources were used and their relevance scores.
