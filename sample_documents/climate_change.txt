Climate Change: Causes and Effects

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate change is a natural phenomenon, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been the primary driver since the mid-20th century.

Primary causes include:
- Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion
- Deforestation and land use changes
- Industrial processes and agriculture
- Transportation systems

Effects of climate change:
- Rising global temperatures
- Melting ice caps and glaciers
- Sea level rise
- Extreme weather events
- Ecosystem disruption

Mitigation strategies include renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency improvements, carbon capture technologies, and international cooperation through agreements like the Paris Climate Accord.
